		We invite you to take part in a research study with the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain
		Sciences (MPI). Please read the following information carefully before you decide to engage in our study.
		Your participation is voluntary and you may choose to withdraw from it anytime without negative consequences or
		having to state your reasons. You can do so by simply returning the HIT, which will close the task. In case you
		choose to withdraw from participation, we will discard any gathered data. The task session will close
		automatically after a timeout visible in the description of the HIT, in which case the HIT will be automatically
		returned and no data will be recorded.
		This study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of Leipzig University, Germany. (ethic
		no. 054/20-ek)
		<br><br>
		<b>Aims of the study</b>
		<br><br>
		We are interested in how the brain translates incoming sensory information into goal-directed behavior on the
		example of object perception. This study aims to investigate how people represent objects. We hope that this
		will improve our understanding of the mental representations that guide us through our world.
		<br><br>

		<b>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</b>
		<br><br>
		You may participate in this study if you understand the provided study information, give your informed consent
		by clicking the box, and are at least 18 years old. Beyond that, there are no explicit exclusion criteria.
		<br><br>
		<b>Insurance</b>
		<br><br>
		By nature of participants being recruited with pseudonyms and by the platform Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), you
		are not covered by the public liability insurance of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain
		Sciences.
		<br><br>
		<b>Expenses</b>
		<br><br>
		The reimbursement for your participation is visible in the description of the HIT.
		<br><br>
		<b>Benefit of this study</b>
		<br><br>
		This study is being conducted for the purpose of basic scientific research. This means that participants will
		receive no direct benefit from it beyond reimbursement. The findings obtained in the course of this study are
		expected to help strongly improve our knowledge in the field of object recognition.
		<br><br>

		<b>Any other questions?</b>
		<br><br>
		If you have any other questions about the various stages of the study, data protection, your rights, or wish to
		receive a PDF version of the consent forms, please contact the head of the study: Martin Hebart -
		hebart@cbs.mpg.de
		<br><br>
		Your agreement to take part in this study would be much appreciated. Many thanks!
