		<b>Declaration of consent on data protection</b>
		<br><br>
		Data collected about me during this study may be used by the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain
		Sciences (MPI-CBS) for the purpose of scientific research.
		<br><br>
		The collected data will be recorded in digital format, stored and scientifically evaluated in a pseudonymised
		way in
		compliance with data protection regulations (i.e. a code comprising numbers and/or letters will be used instead
		of
		your worker ID). The data cannot be associated with your names and contact details, since they are not
		transferred
		from Amazon Mechanical Turk to the requester.
		<br><br>
		Dr. Martin Hebart shall have overall responsibility for the processing of data collected in the course of this
		study.
		<br><br>
		The pseudonymised data which are collected for this study may also be evaluated within the MPI-CBS for related
		research by cooperating scientists, as well as with cooperating scientists at other academic institutions.
		<br><br>
		The Max Planck Society supports the establishment of transparent working practices and forms of cooperation,
		which
		are often summarised under the heading of 'Open Science'. Among other things, this includes access to raw
		scientific
		data - firstly to make research more transparent and thus more discursive, and secondly so that these data can
		serve
		as the basis for subsequent research or be used to ask new questions.
		<br><br>
		The collection of large-scale behavioral data via crowdsourcing is particularly laborious and expensive, and
		they
		represent a valuable resource for scientists. That is why the data collected in this study will not be deleted
		following the completion of the study, but may instead be used to help answer other research problems and/or
		shared
		with other scientists at home and abroad (e.g. at universities or public research institutions). It is also
		possible
		that your pseudonymised personal attributes collected in this study (e.g. age, gender) and the behavioral data
		might
		be submitted to research data platforms on the internet (e.g. the Open Science Framework, www.osf.io). These
		research data platforms enable scientists around the world to access data which have already been collected for
		the
		preparation of supplementary analyses, follow-up work and repeat tests.
		<br><br>
		Please note that transferring and reusing your data in this way may involve them leaving the area subject to
		European data protection legislation. The research data platforms on which the data are stored may also be
		located
		outside the EU. Once they are posted to the research data platforms, these data are made generally available,
		i.e.
		once on the portal, the data can be viewed, downloaded and used by interested parties. From this point on, it is
		no
		longer possible to control or retrospectively restrict the use of these data, or to delete them again. Moreover,
		the
		rights afforded by European law are no longer applicable.
		<br><br>
		If you do not agree in full with your data being transferred in the manner described above, you should not
		consent
		to participation in this study.
		<br><br>
		If the data appear in a scientific publication or are transferred to cooperation partners at universities or
		public
		research institutions or to external service providers, this will proceed in a pseudonymised form without the
		use of
		your name, contact details, or worker ID. All other identifying elements will also be removed. This means that
		it
		will not be possible for anyone within or outside the Max Planck Institute to establish a connection between you
		and
		your data. Nor will it be apparent from the data that you were ever examined.
		<br><br>
		The collected data will be retained for 10 years after the study ends or is aborted. The personal data will then
		be
		deleted unless they have to be retained for a different length of time on legal, statutory or contractual
		grounds.
		<br><br>
		You may request information at any time about the personal data stored about you. If you wish to do so, please
		apply
		to the head of the study (hebart@cbs.mpg.de).
		<br><br>
		The consent granted in this declaration forms the legal basis for the processing of your personal data. You are
		entitled at any time to have the personal data collected about you in this study deleted or rectified or to have
		their processing restricted, provided this proves possible at the time in question. Once given, you may withdraw
		your consent with future effect at any time, without having to state a reason for your decision. It shall remain
		lawful to process your personal data from the time you grant your consent until the time that consent is
		withdrawn.
		Withdrawing consent therefore relates to the processing of data from such time as consent is withdrawn. If you
		wish
		to withdraw your consent, terminate your participation in the study, or have the personal data collected about
		you
		for the study deleted, please get in touch with hebart@cbs.mpg.de.
		<br><br>
		If you have any additional questions regarding data protection, please contact Heidi Schuster, the data
		protection
		officer of the Max Planck Society (Hofgartenstrasse 8, D-80539 München, datenschutz@mpg.de).
		<br><br>
		If you wish to make a complaint, you may file this with the relevant data protection regulatory authority, which
		in
		your case is Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht (BayLDA), Promenade 27, D-91522 Ansbach,
		poststelle@lda.bayern.de.
