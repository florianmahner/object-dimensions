## Experimental Analyses

We provide the main experiments of the paper in the `./experiments` folder. The experiments are divided into the following categories:

- **Dimension Rating Experiment**: Flask experiment to get human observers rate the intepretability of each dimension in the DNN embedding and to give human annotated labels of these dimensions

--**DNN Experiments**: Interpretability analysis of the DNN embeddings (ie activation maximization, causal testing, grad cam)

--**Jackknife**: Jackknife resampling to relate the dimensions of the human and DNN embedding back to behavioral decisions in the triplet task

--**Human Labeling**: Human labeling of the dimensions of the DNN embeddings, categorizing them into visual, mxied visual semantic and semantic

--**RSA**: All Representational Similarity Analyses done for the paper
